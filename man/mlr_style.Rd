\usage{
mlr_style(
  scope = "tokens",
  strict = TRUE,
  indent_by = 2,
  start_comments_with_one_space = FALSE,
  reindention = tidyverse_reindention(),
  math_token_spacing = tidyverse_math_token_spacing(),
  min_lines_for_break = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scope}{The extent of manipulation. Can range from "none" (least
invasive) to "tokens" (most invasive). See 'Details'. This argument is a
string or a vector of class \code{AsIs}.}

\item{strict}{A logical value indicating whether a set of strict
or not so strict transformer functions should be returned. Compare the
functions returned with or without \code{strict = TRUE}. For example,
\code{strict = TRUE} means force \emph{one} space e.g. after "," and \emph{one} line break
e.g. after a closing curly brace. \code{strict = FALSE} means to set spaces and
line breaks to one if there is none and leave the code untouched otherwise.
See 'Examples'.}

\item{indent_by}{How many spaces of indention should be inserted after
operators such as '('.}

\item{start_comments_with_one_space}{Whether or not comments should start
with only one space (see \code{\link[styler:start_comments_with_space]{start_comments_with_space()}}).}

\item{reindention}{A list of parameters for regex re-indention, most
conveniently constructed using \code{\link[styler:reindention]{specify_reindention()}}.}

\item{math_token_spacing}{A list of parameters that define spacing around
math token, conveniently constructed using \code{\link[styler:math_token_spacing]{specify_math_token_spacing()}}.}

\item{min_lines_for_break}{The minimal number of lines required within a
function declaration to make styler adding a blank line between header and
body.}
}
\description{
Style code according to the mlr style guide.
}
\details{
The following options for \code{scope} are available.
\itemize{
\item "none": Performs no transformation at all.
\item "spaces": Manipulates spacing between token on the same line.
\item "indention": In addition to "spaces", this option also manipulates the
indention level.
\item "line_breaks": In addition to "indention", this option also manipulates
line breaks.
\item "tokens": In addition to "line_breaks", this option also manipulates
tokens.
}

As it becomes clear from this description, more invasive operations can only
be performed if all less invasive operations are performed too.
